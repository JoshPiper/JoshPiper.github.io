My first dive into large-scale open source projects.
Starting off as just a Developer, my role was to produce a stable codebase, used by over half a million people.
Moving on, I was promoted into the Core Team, where my responsibility morphed into more general management,
handling development, conflict between staff, and keeping the team ticking over.
