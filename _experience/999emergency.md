Joining as 999 Emergency's Community Manager, my role is twofold.
Managing the Community, and Managing the Team.

Managing the community involves communicating with the project leads and the community,
gathering feedback, distributing news and ensuring all sides stay happy.

Managing the team involves assisting with promotions / demotions,
handling inter- and intrateam communication,
assigning goals and shifting workload to ensure the team remains productive.
