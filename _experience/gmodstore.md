Originally entering as a curator for product submissions, gmodstore has allowed me to develop my skills in customer relationship management, 
acting as a point fo contact for customers, partners and content creators alike. Alongside this my role has expanded, starting from
pure reviews of incoming products, through to moderation, standards enforcement and conflict resolution, finally ending in both
managing a professional moderation team and community expectations and site-wide policies.
