Entering as a Developer, DevOps Engineer and System Administrator for this small development house,
it none-the-less provided me great opportunities.
Not only did this allow me to continue developing my work with CI/CD systems,
it also provided me with a greater exposure to systems within Steam itself.

Furthermore, after working with the company, I was also offered the role of Community Manager.
Within this role, my duties include managing the moderation team,
handling community concerns and feedback, working with the brand's social media,
and generally acting as a face of the company.
