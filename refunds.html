				Discretionary Refunds
			</div>

			<div class="card-body">
				I strive to provide high-quality development services and maintain positive relationships with all my clients;
				the terms outlined below set clear expectations regarding refunds,
				I reserve the right to, outside the terms below,
				additionally grant refunds, discounts or waive fees at my sole discretion,
				should I believe it is appropriate to do so.<br>
			</div>

		<div class="card mb-4">
			<div class="card-header text-center">
				Deposits & Upfront Payments
			</div>

			<div class="card-body">
				Projects may require a non-refundable deposit to secure a booking
				and initiate work.<br>

				Deposits compensate for time spent on consultations, initial research,
				planning, and blocking other work.<br>

				If the client chooses to cancel the project after making the deposit payment,
				the deposit will not be refunded under any circumstances.<br>
			</div>

			<div class="card-header text-center">
				Milestones & Progress Payments
			</div>

			<div class="card-body">
				For projects divided into milestones or phases,
				payments for each completed milestone are non-refundable.<br>

				If a project is terminated by the client before a milestone is reached,
				I reserve the right to retain payment for work completed up to that point,
				and in most cases, no refunds will be issued.<br>
			</div>

		<div class="card mb-4">
			<div class="card-header text-center">
				Revisions & Client Satisfaction
			</div>

			<div class="card-body">
				Reasonable effort will be made to delivery work aligned
				with pre-agreed specifications and requirements.<br>

				Revision requests must be made within the agreed project scope.
				If the client requests changes beyond the original scope,
				additional charges will apply.<br><br>

				Dissatisfaction with creative choices, subjective preferences,
				or changes in business direction on the client’s
				side will not qualify for refunds.<br><br>

				Refunds due to dissatisfaction will only be considered if:<br>
				The delivered work fails to meet clearly documented and
				mutually agreed requirements, and<br>
				Reasonable opportunities for revisions have been provided, and<br>
				I am unable to meet the requirements within a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>

				If a project is terminated by the client before a milestone is reached,
				I reserve the right to retain payment for work completed up to that point,
				and in most cases, no refunds will be issued.<br>

				Project Cancellation by the Developer
			</div>

			<div class="card-body">
				If I need to cancel the project for reasons within my control
				(e.g., personal emergency), a pro-rated refund will be considered
				based on the uncompleted work.<br>

				In cases where no substantial work has started,
				a full refund of payments may be issued.

				Project Cancellation by the Client

				Any work completed will be delivered in its current state (if applicable),
				but no further obligations will exist on my part.

				Clients are responsible for ensuring all third-party accounts, credentials,
				and environments required for development are properly maintained.

				Digital Nature of Work
