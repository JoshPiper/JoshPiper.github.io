One of my key pieces of work at Glorified Studios has been the development of
integrated build and deployment solutions.

For a varied range of engines, from Unity to Love2D,
my role has been to ensure that developers have the least amount of friction possible,
between them writing code and having those built changes deployed to consumers.
