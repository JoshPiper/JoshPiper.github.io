Within [Limelight](https://limelightgaming.info), as the development lead, a major part of my role has been improving team efficiency.
Our team is compromised of a small number of developers, most of who work with Limelight as a secondary or tertiary job.


With this has led to an improvement in the soft skills: People management and conflict resolution.
This has been of key importance here, if one person leaving drops staffing by 15%, each person is key.
