With our low staff levels, we've also have to develop custom tooling in order to improve our workflows.
For example, a system I developed was the suggestions management console,
a key system in improving our [Suggestions Workflow](https://blog.limelightgaming.info/development-blog-9-how-do-suggestions/).


This has led to a 50% decrease in the time spent processing internal suggestion reviews.
In addition, many parts of this system are also fully automated, from polls to requesting review to automatic closing.
