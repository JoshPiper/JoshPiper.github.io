[L² plates](https://plates.limelightgaming.info) is a system written from the ground up in Garry's Mod, using Lua as an embedded scripting language.
The plugin itself is sold on [GModStore](https://gmodstore.com/market/view/l2-plates), with a more advanced build system having been built around it.


This system includes a set of docker containers, running a database and API service for the development tools,
and both GitLab and GitHub pipelines for building and deploying the addon versions,
alongside both the ingame system and development tools themselves.
