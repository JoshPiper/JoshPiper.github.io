One of the major updates I worked on for Limelight was the Emergency Vehicle Update.
This involved working with myself and three other texture artists to create new liveries and configurations for
over 80 vehicles, creating over 70 liveries and hundreds of configurations.


Despite some issues with one of the texture artists becoming unavailable, and some disagreements between the artists and other staff members,
the update only released a few weeks late (impressive considering multi-week delays that happened during development),
this not only allowed me to work on other development skills such as texture work, but also allowed development of the soft skills.
