Generally, Docker worked well by itself, with my interactions being limited to the creation
and management of services and containers, ensuring they interacted well with the rest of the system.

I however, orchestrated systems through Compose,
to handle multiple containers per project (such as for isolated databasing),
and finally managed these services across multiple hosts with Swarm.
