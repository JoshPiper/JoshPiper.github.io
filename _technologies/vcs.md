VCS ensures that changes can be tracked back, breaking changes can be reverted and everything is logged,
whilst also improving productivity through branches, merges and other protections from overwriting code.

Whilst my work has mainly been in using VCS, I've also been called upon to manage VCS services and implement
VCS specific code.
