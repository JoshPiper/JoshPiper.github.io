subtitle: Combining Development, Deployment, Testing and Operations in a unified pipeline.

Working with the multiple technology stacks on the server, combined with DevOps software such
as GitLab, my role as a developer shifted over to DevOps, writing code, ensuring it deployed,
testing it, and making sure works.

This has included use of both GitLab CI and GitHub Actions, deploying to self-contained web-hosts,
to Docker, or to external services such as Steamworks.
