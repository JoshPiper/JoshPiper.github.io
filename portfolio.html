						This system includes a set of docker containers, running a database and API service for the development tool, and a GitLab pipeline for building and deploying the addon versions,

					<p>
						Within <a href="https://limelightgaming.net">Limelight Gaming</a>, as the development lead, a major part of my role has been improving team efficiency.
						Our team is compromised of a small number of developers, most of who work on Limelight as a secondary or tertiary job.

						With this has led to an improvement in the soft skills: People management and conflict resolution.

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						With such a limited staffing level, we've also have to develop custom stacks in order to improve our workflows. For example, a system I developed was the
						suggestions management console, a key part of improving our <a href="https://blog.limelightgaming.info/development-blog-9-how-do-suggestions/">suggestions workflow</a>.

					<p>
						This has led to a 50% decrease in the time spent processing internal suggestion reviews.

						Whilst for many a boring subject, data protection is of key interest to me, hence why I put myself forward for for the data protection role.

				</div>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						One of the major updates I worked on for Limelight was the Emergency Vehicle Update.
						This involved working with myself and three other texture artists to create new liveries and configurations for
						over 80 vehicles, creating over 70 liveries and hundreds of configurations.<br>

					<p>
						Despite some issues with one of the texture artists becoming unavailable, and some disagreements between the artists and other staff members,
						the update only released a few weeks late (impressive considering multi-week delays that happened during development),
						this not only allowed me to work on other development skills such as texture work, but also allowed development of the soft skills.

					<p>
						One of my key pieces of work at Glorified Studios has been the development of integrated build and deployment solutions.

						For a varied range of engines, from Unity to Love2D, my role has been to ensure that developers have the least amount of friction possible,
						between them writing code and having those built changes deployed to consumers.

				</div>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						One of my most used pieces of software to date is the secure document store.

						This Node.JS application was written to securely store documents, providing selective access to users based on various criteria,
						such as group filtering.

						Access to individual documents is controlled by an ACL, with groups also having individual permission nodes for audit and management purposes.

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p>
						These are all passed through to a backend secured with current best practices,
						such as the use of non-incremental IDs, using external authentication sources to remove the requirement for passwords.
					</p>

					<p>
						Furthermore, access was also built into the application for automatic updating of documents from external sources,
						such as our staff guidelines, which are automatically built from asciidoc source files, with built files deployed to the store.
