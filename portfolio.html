						With such a limited staffing level, we've also have to develop custom stacks in order to improve our workflows. For example, a system I developed was the

						One of the major updates I worked on for Limelight was the Emergency Vehicle Update.

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>
						One of my most used pieces of software to date is the secure document store.

						This Node.JS application was written to securely store documents, providing selective access to users based on various criteria,

						Access to individual documents is controlled by an ACL, with groups also having individual permission nodes for audit and management purposes.

					<p>
						These are all passed through to a backend secured with current best practices,
						such as the use of non-incremental IDs, using external authentication sources to remove the requirement for passwords.
					</p>

					<p>
						Furthermore, access was also built into the application for automatic updating of documents from external sources,
						such as our staff guidelines, which are automatically built from asciidoc source files, with built files deployed to the store.
